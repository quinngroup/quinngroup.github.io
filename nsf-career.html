                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a <strong>quantitative
                  and objective measure</strong> of ciliary motion beat patterns.
                </p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="img-responsive img-circle" src="images/nsf-career/cilia_structure.png" alt="">
                    <caption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Cell body and cilia as
                    viewed through a high-speed digital videomicroscope using
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_interference_contrast_microscopy">
                    differential interference contrast (DIC)</a> imaging.</caption>
                </div>

                <p>
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium">Cilia are microscopic
                  hair-like projections from cells</a> (Fig. 1). They beat in rhythmic patterns
                  and perform a variety of functions, such as mucociliary clearance
                  in the lungs and generating motility for sperm. Cilia also
                  play sensory and signaling roles that are largely understood
                  to involve the <em>primary</em> cilia, but which has also been
                  recently implicated in <em>motile</em> cilia. Cilia are present
                  along almost every major organ, including but not limited to:
                  lungs, brain, kidneys, and throat.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Because of their presence throughout nearly all the major organs
                  of the body, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliopathy">
                  ciliopathies, or diseases of the cilia</a>, can have wide-ranging
                  impacts. Nearly all ciliopathies are the result of genetic
                  mutations, but these mutations can impact either proteins that
                  form the ciliary <em>ultrastructure</em>, or the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraflagellar_transport">
                  intraflagellar transport (IFT)</a> system that kicks off
                  ciliogenesis, or the formation and maintainence system for
                  all the cilia in the body.
                </p>

                    <caption><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Schematics of generally-
                    recognized phenotypes of ciliary motion.</caption>
                </div>

                <p>
                  Currently, the identification of ciliopathies is a process
                  involving multiple evaluation methods. One of the more well-known
                  methods is to compute <em>ciliary beat frequency</em> (CBF).
                  CBF outside of a "normal" range (10-12Hz) tends to indicate
                  the presence of a ciliopathy. However, there are numerous
                  confounding variables that can present as a CBF outside that
                  range despite the absence of a ciliopathy; conversely,
                  certain ciliopathies can present without a detectable change
                  in CBF. Finally, there is not a well-established methodology
                  for rigorously evaluating CBF for a given sample. Other
                  evaluation methods--electron microscopy to examine the ciliary
                  ultrastructure, evaluation of ciliary beat pattern--likewise
                  have utility but are ultimately not definitive.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In this project, it's the <strong>ciliary beat pattern</strong>
                  we are focused on. Researchers and clinicians generally recognize
                  the presence of multiple discrete ciliary beat patterns (Fig. 2), but
                  they are assessed entirely by manual inspection. Put another
                  way, there is no <strong>rigorously-defined library of ciliary
                  motion phenotypes</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We have established some methods that have proven useful
                  for large-scale quantitative screening and analysis of ciliary
                  motion. We first began investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow">
                  flow-based features</a> in our 2011 conference paper<sup>[<a href="#bsec">1</a>]</sup>. We
                  wrapped this into a full-fledged binary classifier in our
                  landmark 2015 <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>
                  publication<sup>[<a href="#stm">2</a>]</sup>, achieving over 90% classification accuracy of
                  normal versus abnormal ciliary motion using a support vector
                  machine trained on two different feature sets. These feature
                  sets revealed a low-dimensional manifold where the qualitative
                  differences between normal and abnormal ciliary motion could
                  be easily visualized (Fig. 3).
                </p>

                  <div class="col-md-5">
                      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/nsf-career/subspace.png" alt="">
                      <caption><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Normal (left) and
                      abnormal (right) ciliary motion, parameterized and
                      projected into a 3D principal component subspace.</caption>
                  </div>

                <p>
                  This paper and its findings led to a multitide of additional
                  questions, many of which we are seeking to address as part
                  of this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>What constitutes a "good" subspace of ciliary
                    motion, and how could it be used to identify ciliary
                    motion phenotypes?</strong> As indicated in Fig. 1, it's
                    well-established that multiple ciliary motion phenotypes
                    exist, but we have no way of quantitatively defining them.
                    Our 2015 paper "merely" performed normal/abnormal binary
                    classification, ignoring any other details. There is
                    evidence to suggest these "details" may correlate
                    with specific genetic mutations and, therefore, provide
                    a key for rapidly screening samples. On the advanced end,
                    being able to "generate" samples of ciliary motion that
                    adhere to certain motion statistics would be an incredibly
                    useful research and diagnostic tool.
                </p>

                <div class="col-md-5" style="float: right;">
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/nsf-career/segmentation.png" alt="">
                    <caption><strong>Figure 4</strong>: Cilia (left) and the
                    accompanying ground-truth segmentation mask (right) that
                    indicate regions containing cilia and not containing cilia.</caption>
                </div>

                <p>
                  <strong>How can cilia be automatically identified in video
                    samples?</strong> This may sound like a straightforward
                    application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation#Motion_&_Interactive_Segmentation">
                    semantic video segmentation</a> (we thought the same!), but it
                    turns out that for cilia this is a surprisingly difficult
                    challenge to do well<sup>[<a href="#isbi">3</a>]</sup> (Fig. 4).
                    Identifying cilia requires clever combinations of both spatial
                    and temporal features: cilia have a texture (sometimes),
                    and also motion (sometimes), but neither is definitive on its own.
                    Requiring researchers or clinicians to manually annotate
                    samples is not only extremely labor-intensive, it's also
                    very error-prone.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How can crowdsourcing be leveraged to include expert
                    input while still controlling for subjectivity?</strong> One
                    of the biggest drawbacks of the current process for ciliopathy
                    identification is that it relies heavily on manual inspection.
                    Nevertheless, the extensive clinical and/or laboratory training
                    that researchers undergo should not be discounted; rather, it
                    should be included while being kept in context.
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning#Metric_learning">
                    Metric learning</a> provides a promising framework for how to
                    approach the inclusion of manual annotations into an automated
                    pattern recognition pipeline, but there is also physical
                    infrastructure that is required for this: how would the interface
                    be designed not only to encourage user recruitment and
                    retainment, but also to incentivize high-quality feedback?
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>How can researchers and clinicians be encouraged to
                  share their data and analyses?</strong> Notably, no open datasets
                  exist around cilia research, genomic or image. Furthermore, of
                  the little bit of software developed around ciliary motion or
                  structure analysis, none--including ours from the 2015 paper--
                  is available as open source. We aim to build an integrated
                  web platform, <em>CiliaWeb</em>, that is a one-stop-shop for
                  aggregating datasets (with permission, of course), building
                  reproducible ciliary analysis pipelines, and providing high-quality
                  interactive visualizations and feedback. We also aim to open source
                  the analytics and visualization engines developed as part of this
                  project, so researchers can deploy their own versions of CiliaWeb.
                  Finally, we're looking to generate a small amount of control
                  and experimental genomic and image data that can be openly and
                  publicly released for others to validate our results.

                  <li>Spectral graph analytics</li>
                  <li>Metric learning</li>
                  <li>Differential programming and deep architecture design</li>
                  <li>Genomic associations with common ciliopathies</li>
                  <li>Role of intraflagellar transport in ciliogenesis and maintenance</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Preferred candidates should also be proficient in Python and
                at least one of the many popular deep learning libraries (e.g.,
                PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras), familiar with the git versioning
                system, and willing to conduct their research according
                to the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science">
                Open Science</a>: emphasizing reproducibility, study
                pre-registration, pre-publication archival, and publishing
                both data and software under permissive open licenses.
              </p>

              <p>
                The candidate and the PI will formalize an evaluation system
                consisting of regular check-ins, both to ensure timely progress
                on the project, and to facilitate the candidate's career goals
                and transition to an independent position (or toward whatever
                their ultimate career aspirations may be).

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <p>Some questions that have both been asked, or which I'm
                  hopefully cutting off at the pass.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm interested in the project, but HOLY CRAP that list
                of topics in the postdoc job ad is HUGE! Can I still apply?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">YES! That list is meant to convey
                the rich variety of topics spanned by this 5-year research
                project, and to encourage people with a variety of backgrounds to
                apply! Do you have highly theoretical machine learning expertise
                in image representations? Apply! Are you an expert on web frameworks
                and user interface design? Apply! Did you do some bench work and
                computational analysis outside of imaging? Apply!</p>

                <p><strong>I want to apply but my imposter syndrome is in full
                swing and you'll probably get more qualified candidates than me.
                Why should I apply?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Speaking as someone who at times
                has been wholesale paralyzed by imposter syndrome, I can say
                with confidence: you're more qualified than you think. Like any
                person suffering from imposter syndrome, it's far more likely
                that you'll be among the <em>most</em> qualified. So please apply!
                Perhaps we could jointly plot ways to keep fooling everyone around us
                while we do some really neat work studying cilia!</p>

                <p><strong>Great! Here's my CV. When do I start getting paid?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">This is a question I get a lot,
                and unfortunately the answer usually isn't what people are hoping.
                The bottom line is that I can't guarantee funding until we've
                at least had a chance to speak in real-time. History (not just
                mine) has demonstrated that while background and experience are
                certainly important, far more important is how well you and I
                (and <a href="people.html">the rest of my research group</a>)
                can work together. That can only be assessed by setting up
                some time to chat. Ideally this would entail taking a course with
                me, though I know that's not always possible. Suffice to say,
                we should set aside time to discuss things if you absolutely have
                to be guaranteed funding before you'll even consider applying.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;"><em>[NOTE: The above largely applies
                only to doctoral student applicants. Postdoctoral candidates go
                through a much more formal application and interview process.]</em></p>

                <p><strong>I'm not really a team player; rather, I'm a wicked good
                coder who will spend nights and weekends knocking down these research
                questions. When can I start?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Never. The tech sector and academia
                at large may still be enamored with the "difficult but talented"
                individual, but that goes against our group ethos. Plus, "talent"
                and "decency" are most certainly <em>not</em> mutually exclusive! We
                certainly work hard, but we also explicitly focus on communication,
                respect, and inclusiveness.</p>

                <p><strong>Is this project only for doctoral students and postdocs?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Not at all! I've had quite a few
                very successful undergraduate students conduct research with me for
                course credit, for CURO, and even for transitioning into Double
                Dawgs. Not only that, but I'm also an active participant in the
                <a href="https://hr.uga.edu/employees/training/uga-young-dawgs-program/">
                UGA Young Dawgs program</a> and recruited students from high
                schools in the Athens area. My only preference for recruiting
                undergraduates is that you start working with me in your second
                or third year, so we have time to develop some momentum and
                develop a good professional rapport.</p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">If you're an undergraduate and
                want to work on this project, just
                <a href="mailto:squinn@cs.uga.edu?Subject=Interested in CiliaWeb">
                shoot me an email</a>!</p>

                <p><strong>I'm a life sciences student/graduate with little to no
                computational experience. Should I still apply?</strong></p>

                <p style="padding-left: 20px;">As long as you are open to and
                enthusiastic about picking up at least some computational skills,
                then absolutely yes! You will be expected to pick up
                some fundamental skills in machine learning and coding, and this will
                certainly comprise the majority of your work, but there will also
                be opportunities to do some bench and wet lab work.</p>

                <p><strong>I have a question that isn't answered here. How do I
                  get it answered?</strong></p>
