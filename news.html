                <p>Happy 2018! It's off to quite the running start--</p>

                <p>The group had <strong>three</strong> submissions accepted to the 2018
                  IEEE <a href="http://biomedicalimaging.org/2018/">International Symposium
                  on Biomedical Imaging</a>; two papers and a poster. That by itself will certainly
                  keep us busy, especially as we get closer to April! Congratulations to
                  <strong>Narita Pandhe</strong>, <strong>Mojtaba Fazli</strong>, and
                  <strong>Charles Lu</strong>, who were the respective first authors of the
                  three accepted works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additional congratulations to <strong>Narita Pandhe</strong> for successfully
                  defending her master's thesis last November! It went flawlessly, and even
                  though we'd love for her to stick around here for a Ph.D., we know she'll
                  accomplish great things in the next stage of her career. Good luck!
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Ankita Joshi</strong> also successfully defended her master's thesis
                  on scalable spectral clustering with Apache Spark! She will be staying at
                  UGA to complete a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This semester we welcome a cohort of new students conducting directed studies
                  in the group.
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Zane Page</strong> is an undergraduate in Computer Science who
                      will be reviving the biosurveillance work, picking up from our 2016
                      DSAA publication and helping us get our R-21 off the ground.</li>
                    <li><strong>Andrew Durden</strong> is an undergraduate in Computer Science
                      who will be taking the helm on the OrNet project, and assisting
                      <strong>Mojtaba</strong> in his work developing and refining biomedical
                      imaging protocols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weiwen Xu</strong> is a master's student in Computer Science
                      who will be developing new optimization strategies and employing
                      evolutionary computing to apply to the computational olfaction project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prajay Shetty</strong> is a master's student in Computer Science
                      who will be assisting <strong>Charles</strong> with the cilia project,
                      and focusing on developing fully-automated cilia segmentation strategies.</li>
                  </ul>

                  Good luck to the newcomers!
                </p>

                <p>On the note of impending graduation, <strong>Roi Ceren</strong>
                  is scheduled to defend his Ph.D. thesis at the end of the semester,
                  and <strong>Rajeswari Sivakumar</strong> will likewise defend her
                  master's in Artificial Intelligence sometime over the summer. Best of
                  luck to the both of them in the coming months!</p>

                <p>Finally, Dr. Quinn is offering the second-ever rendition of
                  <a href="https://dsp-uga.github.io/sp18/">CSCI 8360 Data Science Practicum</a>,
                  which this semester is supported by a very generous education grant
                  from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>. After a
                  prolific 2017 of submitting nearly 20 grant proposals, he's aiming at
                  fewer but more substantial grants in 2018, including the long-delayed
                  mentored K-25 in computational neuroscience, his 2nd attempt for the NSF
                  CAREER, an R-21 or two, and some SBIR/STTR grants.</p>

                <p>Best of luck to everyone this spring!</p>

                <h4>Sept. 30, 2017</h4>
                <p>Bit of a late update; things have been busy!</p>

                <p>This semester, we'll be seeing <em>three</em> students graduate from the lab! <strong>Alekhya Chennupati</strong> will graduate this December with a Master's in Computer Science, after having successfully defended her thesis this past May which examined quantitative measures of ciliary motion. <strong>Narita Pandhe</strong> is working toward a defense date this semester, and is planning to graduate with a Master's in Computer Science. Her thesis is investigating a two-stream spatio-temporal generative model of neutrophils. <strong>Ankita Joshi</strong> is also working toward a defense date this semester, and will graduate with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence. Her research is in the implementation of an end-to-end scalable spectral clustering algorithm, to be released as open source.</p>

                <p>We wish them all the best of luck!</p>

                <p>We have a couple of new additions to the group as well! <strong>Roi Ceren</strong> is not technically new as he enters his final year of Ph.D. studies in Computer Science, but with any luck his first year in this group will be his last as a Ph.D. student! He is working to finalize his thesis in scalable decision theory with an application in gaming reinforcement behavior. <strong>Dominic Gray</strong> is a new Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://ideas.ecology.uga.edu/">IDEAS program</a>; with interests in public health and biosurveillance, he is jointly supervised between Dr. Quinn and <a href="https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/">Dr. John Drake</a> of Ecology.</p>

                <p><strong>Rajeswari Sivakumar</strong> and <strong>Christian McDaniel</strong> are new Master's students in Artificial Intelligence, and have both hit the ground running this semester in diving into their research in neuroscience by participating in the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Synapse:syn8717496/wiki/422884">Parkinson's DREAM Challenge</a>.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Quinn is teaching the first-ever offering of <a href="https://eds-uga.github.io/csci4360-fa17/">CSCI 4360/6360 Data Science II</a>, and is applying for grants at a record pace--four in the coming month of October alone! Fingers crossed!</p>

                <p>Good luck to everyone this fall!</p>

                <p>With this batch of updates, we bid a hearty congratulations and fond farewell to <strong>Madhura Gadgil</strong>, who successfully defended her master's thesis <em>Large-Scale Semi-Supervised Learning</em> last December. We wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors!</p>

                <p>We also welcome a couple new faces to the group: <strong>Jonathan Waring</strong> and <strong>Charles Lu</strong>, both Computer Science majors. Jonathan will be working on biosurveillance, and Charles in deep learning. Good luck to both!</p>
